# Keyboard Navigation

MetaGrouper provides comprehensive keyboard navigation for efficient, mouse-free operation. Learn all the keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns.

## Basic Movement

Navigate through the tree structure using arrow keys:

- **↓ (Down Arrow)**: Move to the next visible node
- **↑ (Up Arrow)**: Move to the previous visible node
- **Home**: Jump to the first node
- **End**: Jump to the last node

## Expand/Collapse Operations

Control node expansion and collapse:

- **→ (Right Arrow)**:
  - Expand the current node if collapsed
  - Move to first child if already expanded
- **← (Left Arrow)**:
  - Collapse the current node if expanded
  - Move to parent node if already collapsed

## Actions

Perform common operations:

- **Enter**:
  - Open file (if file node)
  - Toggle expand/collapse (if folder/tag node)
- **Space**: Toggle expand/collapse

## Focus Management

Move focus between interface elements:

- **Tab**: Move focus into the tree (from toolbar)
- **Shift + Tab**: Move focus out of the tree
- Focused nodes are highlighted with an outline

## Quick Reference Card

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ↓ | Next node |
| ↑ | Previous node |
| → | Expand node / Move to first child |
| ← | Collapse node / Move to parent |
| Enter | Open file / Toggle node |
| Space | Toggle expand/collapse |
| Home | First node |
| End | Last node |
| Tab | Focus tree (from toolbar) |
| Shift+Tab | Focus toolbar (from tree) |

## Navigation Patterns

### Tree Traversal
- Use **→** and **←** to navigate the hierarchy
- Combine with **↑** and **↓** for precise movement
- **Home** and **End** for quick jumps to tree boundaries

### Efficient Workflows
1. **Tab** into the tree from toolbar
2. Use **→** to expand sections of interest
3. **↓** and **↑** to scan through items
4. **Enter** to open files or **Space** to explore further
5. **Shift+Tab** to return to toolbar controls

### Large Tree Navigation
- Start with **Home** to begin at the top
- Use **→** sparingly to avoid expanding everything
- **←** to collapse and move up when done exploring
- **End** to quickly check the bottom of the tree

## Accessibility Features

The keyboard navigation system includes:

- **ARIA roles**: Proper semantic structure for screen readers
- **Keyboard accessible**: Full functionality without mouse
- **Focus indicators**: Clear visual feedback for current position
- **Logical tab order**: Intuitive focus movement through the interface

## Tips for Efficiency

### Power User Techniques
- Learn the **→/←** pattern for hierarchical navigation
- Use **Home/End** for quick orientation
- Combine keyboard navigation with toolbar shortcuts
- Practice moving through trees without looking at the keyboard

### Integration with Workflows
- Navigate while reading file contents
- Quickly jump between related files
- Maintain context while exploring hierarchies
- Use keyboard shortcuts for frequent operations

## Troubleshooting

### Navigation Not Working

**Symptom**: Arrow keys don't navigate the tree

**Solutions**:
1. Click on a node first to focus the tree
2. Check that focus is in the tree (not toolbar or search)
3. Try pressing Tab to move focus into the tree

### Focus Issues

**Symptom**: Can't move focus as expected

**Solutions**:
1. Use Tab to cycle through focusable elements
2. Click directly on tree nodes to establish focus
3. Check for modal dialogs that might capture focus
