### Major UI Overhaul

The plugin UI has been completely redesigned to strictly adhere to Obsidian's native design standards, providing a more polished and consistent experience.

#### Settings Interface

- **Modern Settings Layout**: Refactored settings to use Obsidian-native patterns with proper heading hierarchy and organized sections
- **Icon Buttons**: Replaced text buttons with icon buttons (pencil, copy, trash) for a cleaner interface
- **Star Toggle**: Default view is now indicated by a star icon instead of a dropdown

  - Hierarchy levels collapse by default

  - Collapse state preserved across re-renders to prevent user frustration
